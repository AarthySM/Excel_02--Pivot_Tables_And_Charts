# *Remote Work and Mental Health Analysis Project*

## *Overview*
This project examines the relationship between remote work, job roles, work-life balance, stress levels, and overall employee satisfaction during the era of remote work. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights for improving employee well-being and productivity across various job roles, age groups, and work locations. 

## *Objective*
The main goal of this project was to analyze data to understand the impact of remote work on different aspects of employee mental health and productivity. By leveraging pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting, the project uncovers key insights to enhance organizational support systems and remote work policies.

## *Key Skills Demonstrated*
1. *Data Cleaning and Processing*  
   - Organized raw data by removing unnecessary columns,checking for missing values and inconsistencies to prepare a clean and accurate dataset for analysis.
   - Created new columns based on categories such as Age Group, Years of Experience Category, and Work-Life Balance Rating for better segmentation.

2. *Pivot Tables and Charts*  
   - Designed multiple pivot tables to extract insights from the data, focusing on different aspects like job roles, age groups, experience levels, work locations, and more.
   - Created charts to visually represent insights, making complex data more accessible and actionable.

3. *Conditional Formatting*  
   - Applied conditional formatting to highlight key trends, making it easier to identify areas of concern such as high stress levels or low satisfaction ratings.

4. *Data Analysis & Insights Generation*  
   - Analyzed relationships between job roles, satisfaction with remote work, work-life balance, stress, and productivity.
   - Provided clear, concise insights based on the analysis, including:
     - Identifying the job roles with the highest and lowest levels of satisfaction.
     - Understanding how age groups affect stress levels and work-life balance.
     - Revealing which work locations and hours contributed to higher satisfaction levels.

5. *Report Writing*  
   - Summarized the findings into actionable insights for the organization, which can be used to improve mental health support, remote work policies, and overall employee well-being.
   - Presented the analysis in a clear and structured manner, making it easy for decision-makers to implement changes.

## *Project Structure*
The project is divided into several key sections, each focused on different aspects of the data analysis:

1. *Work-Life Balance by Job Role*  
   Analysis of how different job roles experience work-life balance and their overall satisfaction with remote work.

2. *Stress Level by Age Group*  
   Examination of how age influences stress levels, social isolation, and work hours.

3. *Productivity Change by Years of Experience*  
   Insight into how years of experience impact productivity changes during remote work transitions.

4. *Overall Satisfaction by Work Location*  
   Exploration of how remote, hybrid, and onsite work arrangements affect employee satisfaction, work-life balance, and hours worked.

5. *Stress and Social Isolation*  
   Focused analysis on the relationship between stress levels and social isolation, particularly in remote work settings.

## *Final Insights*
The analysis yielded several key findings:
- *Job Role Insights*: HR and Project Managers reported the lowest satisfaction with remote work, while Data Scientists and Sales personnel experienced higher satisfaction.
- *Stress and Age*: Younger employees (under 30) reported higher stress levels, necessitating targeted mental health resources.
- *Productivity and Experience*: Senior employees adapted better to remote work, showing higher productivity compared to junior employees.
- *Work Location*: Hybrid work arrangements provided the best balance between productivity and employee satisfaction.

## *Tools & Technologies Used*
- *Microsoft Excel*: Used for data cleaning, creating pivot tables, applying conditional formatting, and generating charts.
- *Data Visualization*: Created informative charts and graphs to display key insights clearly.
- *Data Analysis*: Applied strong analytical skills to extract meaningful insights and provide actionable recommendations.

## *Key Takeaways*
Through this project, I have demonstrated my ability to:
- Effectively clean, process, and prepare data for analysis.
- Use Excel to create complex pivot tables and charts to derive meaningful insights.
- Apply conditional formatting to highlight important trends.
- Write clear and concise reports that offer valuable recommendations for improving employee well-being and productivity.
